	<h1>Guan Yu is a stalwart general who firmly believes in justice and virtue.</h1>
	<p>Guan Yu (onyomi: Kan U) is arguably one of Liu Bei's bravest and strongest generals. Despite his spotty military record and arrogant behavior, his Romance of the Three Kingdoms portrayal is known for being a mighty warrior with a studious mind who could cleave apart an "army of thousands with ease." His well-kept beard was famous, and he was nicknamed "Beautiful Beard" (鬚髯) by his peers. Years after his death, he has been dubbed one of the Five Tiger Generals and worshiped as Guandi (関帝, lit. Emperor Guan) or Guangong (関公, lit. Duke Guan), the God of brotherhood, justice and righteousness; thus to this day it is common to see statues of him on altars at various Chinese shops. His historical children are Guan Ping and Guan Xing.</p>
